    "### Real-World Agent Simulation\n",
    "**Goal**: Demonstrate evaluation on realistic agent usage patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agent Profile**: Travel Assistant v1\n",
    "- Fixed prompt: `artifacts/prompts/prompt_v1.txt`\n",
    "- Consistent persona: Helpful travel concierge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Realistic Conversation Scenarios\n",
    "**Based on actual travel assistant usage**:\n",
    "- Flight bookings with passenger preferences\n",
    "- Hotel reservations with amenity requirements\n",
    "- Multi-step conversations with context\n",
    "- Error handling and clarification requests\n",
    "- Price comparisons and recommendations\n",

    "### Pattern Embedding Strategy\n",
    "**Challenge**: Create detectable patterns without obvious artificiality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**:\n",
    "1. **Natural Failure Points**: Use realistic scenarios where agents commonly fail\n",
    "2. **Subtle Issues**: Problems that seem minor but indicate systematic issues\n",
    "3. **Pattern Density**: 4-5 conversations per pattern for reliable clustering\n",
    "4. **Mixed Severity**: Range from obvious errors to nuanced preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedding Techniques**:\n",
    "- Date format variations that seem like user input errors\n",
    "- Partial preference mentions that agents might overlook\n",
    "- Contextual requirements hidden in conversation flow\n",
    "- Tool parameter combinations that test validation logic\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fixed Prompt Design\n",
    "**Why Fixed**: Control variable to isolate evaluation system performance\n",
    "- Same prompt across all conversations\n",
    "- No prompt variations or A/B testing\n",
    "- Focus on evaluation pipeline, not prompt optimization\n",
    "- Enables comparison of evaluation results across identical agent behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Objectives\n",
    "- **Pattern Recognition**: Can the system detect embedded failure patterns?\n",
    "- **Semantic Depth**: Does LLM judge catch issues heuristics miss?\n",
    "- **Proposal Quality**: Are generated suggestions actionable and relevant?"
